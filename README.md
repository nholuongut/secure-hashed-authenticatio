# Secure Hashed Authentication

blake2b & md5 based registration and login in PHP to show a secure hashed password.

</p>

## How it works
- The project uses both blake2b and md5 to hash the password so it can't be unencrypted or stolen or intercepted.
- We first remove backslashes to ensure no XSS Attack can take place.
- We then escape special characters in a string to ensure SQL Injection and XSS Attacks aren't possible. This doesn't affect the password's strength as the user enters the same password to login as while signing up. He/she won't even know this procedure took place.
- The password is hashed with the blake2b hashing algorithm.
- The password is then hashed with the md5 hashing algorithm.
- The same procedure is repeated for both login and registration to ensure the final hashed value is the same and hence login doesn't fail.
